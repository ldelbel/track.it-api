## Project Briefing <a name = "brief"></a>

**--This is the back-end API of a full stack project, to see the React front-end, check [here](https://github.com/ldelbel/track.it)**

This project is the Final Capstone Project required for completing the Microverse Technical Curriculum [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

The capstone project is performed under time restrictions and presents business-like specifications to be followed. The goal is to simulate as much as possible the real conditions of business situations and practice professional execution.

The specifications of this project can be found in the [Tracking App](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Tracking-App-22e454da738c46efaf17721826841772).

## Technical Requirements <a name = "require"></a>

The original specification and design for the project followed those of [Gregoire Vella's on Behance 'Bodytrack.it'](https://www.behance.net/gallery/13271423/Bodytrackit-An-iOs-app-Branding-UX-and-UI). It was required to follow the design and we are supposed to change the theme of the project. I chose to make fully functional running app to challenge myself and for learning purposes.

The provided requirements stated that we must build the app following these guidelines:

- Connects to the back-end API to send and receive domain data
- With routes for each of the screens, so the user can easily go back and forward
- Using redux to store info used across the app, like the username

This project is a **Full Stack Project**, built in two parts. This repository contains the back-end, and this [link](https://github.com/ldelbel/track.it) will lead you to the repository where the front-end (the React interface) is.

## Structure and Quality Control <a name = "arch"></a>

### API Structure

This application is the backend API to be used exclusively by the its counterpart on the Track.it Full Stack project. The front-end project, built with React, can be found [here](https://github.com/ldelbel/track.it)
